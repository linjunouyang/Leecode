    Recursion:

    Kind of divide and conquer process. Beginning from the bottom, for null nodes we just return null.
    If the node is 1, or if any child of it is not null, we return itself, otherwise we return null.
    Only when a node has two null children, and itself is also 0, we return null
    and the null will be assigned to its parentâ€™s left/right, so we pruned the tree.

    Time complexity:  O(n) n = number of nodes
    Space complexity: O(h) h = height of the tree, the size of the implicit stack in our recursion
