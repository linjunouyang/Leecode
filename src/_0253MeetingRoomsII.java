     * 1. Priority Queues
     *
     * Intuition: If we do this manually, we would sort meetings by starting time
     * Reason:
     * If sorted, we only need to consider possible overlaps between previous ending times and new starting time
     * Otherwise, we need to consider conflicts at two ends
     *
     * Consider a concrete example and think about how to solve it.
     * We can find out that:
     * 1) We compare the new starting time with all ongoing ones' ending time, determine a new room or not
     * 2) We don't care about which specific room is free. As long as there is one free room, we use it
     * -> Keep all rooms in a min heap, with key being ending time
     *
     * 1. Sort the given meetings by their start time.
     * 2. Initialize a new min-heap and add the first meeting's ending time to the heap.
     * 3. For every meeting room check if the minimum element of the heap i.e. the room at the top of the heap is free or not.
     * If the room is free, then we extract the topmost element and add it back with the ending time of the current meeting we are processing.
     * If not, then we allocate a new room and add it to the heap.
     * 4. After processing all the meetings, the size of the heap will be the answer
     *
     * O(log n) time for the enqueing and dequeing methods (offer, poll, remove() and add)
     * O(n) for the remove(Object) and contains(Object) methods
     * O(1) for the retrieval methods (peek, element, and size)
     *
     * Time: O(NlogN)
     * sorting: O(NlogN)
     *
     * Space: O(N)

     * 3. Sweep line
     *
     * Two implementations: 1) TreeMap 2) Event class
     *
     * This is the same approach Elements of Programming Interviews book takes for Meeting Rooms type problems.
     * The idea is that we only need to keep track of "space occupied".
     *
     * Say you have [1,10],[2,12],[14,15] (2 rooms needed, for 1,10 and 2,12 to 14,15).
     *
     * We know 1,10 and 2,12 overlap, because 2,10's start time (2) comes before 1,10's end time (10).
     * So, we can reduce that logic to:
     * increment counter for the number of start times (represents space occupied by each interval),
     * decrement for end times.
     * The maximum value of counter at any given point translates to the number of space occupied (in meeting rooms terms, a room).
     * To facilitate this list of times while keeping track of their status (start vs end),
     * we can use a TreeMap since it keeps track of the natural order of the keys. We will use the time as keys, start/end as value.
     *
     * The TreeMap step will be populated like so:
     * 1(start), 2(start), 10(end), 12(end), 14(start), 15(end).
     *
     * Keep in mind treemap insertion is log(n) time for each element (nlogn to populate with n items)
     *
     * 九章算法的扫描线算法差不多，只不过用的是List(unordered)，所以需要Collections.sort来排序
     * ----
     * My understanding: this method is a bit like Valid Parentheses:
     * we need to pair an open time of meeting with exactly a close time of meeting followed by it.
     * So example 1(start), 2(start),10(end),12(end), 14(start),15(end) -
     * > open, open, close, close, open, close.
     * We can easily see there are two consecutive open, we need 2 meeting rooms.
