    2. Iteration
    ---------------------------------------
    Similar to BFS. -> Level order traversal

    We need to swap the left and right child of all nodes.

    **The queue is to store nodes whose children have not been swapped yet.**
    Initially, only the root is in the queue.

    As long as the queue is not empty, remove the next node from the queue,
    swap its children, and add its children to the queue.
    Null nodes are not added to the queue.

    Eventually, the queue will be empty and all the children swapped.
    We return the original root.
    ---------------------------------------
    Time complexity: O(n)
    Space complexity: O(n)
    Worst case: the queue contain all nodes in one level of the binary tree.
    For a full binary tree, the leaf level has n/2 -> O(n) leaves
    ---------------------------------------
    Deque and Queue are both queue interfaces. FIFO. -> BFS
    Interface: Iterable <- Collection <- Queue <- Deque
    Class AbstractCollection <- ArrayDeque

    Queue interface extends Collection interface.
    Queue interface implementation: PriorityQueue, LinkedList
    Inherited from Collection: size(), isEmpty(), contains()

    Queues typically, but not necessarily , order elements in a FIFO manner.
    Its implementations generally don't allow null insertion. (Exception: LinkedList)

    Methods:
    return values: offer(e), poll(), peek()
    throws exception: add(e), remove(), element()



    Deque: double-ended queue, extends Queue. FIFO / LIFO
    supports insertion and removal at both ends
    faster than Stack and LinkedList

    Features: resizeable, Array deques prohibit null
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deque-interface-java-example/

    This interface should be used in preference to the legacy Stack class.
    Better not to insert null.




    Stack class extends class Vector. (FILO)
    It has a way of accessing an element by position. (bad)

    class LinkedList implements List and Deque interfaces.

    Using stack to store all the nodes (not-null) whose children have not been swapped.

    Advantage of stack: ease of logging / debugging.
    At any point of execution, you can log the size of your stack, do something
